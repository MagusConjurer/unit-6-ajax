Using AJAX to pull from the Giphy API

Link to the live page [here](https://magusconjurer.github.io/unit-6-ajax/).

### Idea
This is the week six project from the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp. Using our new knowledge of AJAX, we were tasked to create a page using API calls.

### How it works
Press a button to select a topic. 10 matching GIFs will be shown on the page. The user can click to start/stop the image.

Using the form, the user can enter a new topic they would like GIFs for. A button will be added to the page for them to select.
